07/17/2024 15:53,"I’ve seen that data from the Zyn test and feel confident it’s legit and clean. However, I’ve not seen similar tests done on any other brands. So, I wonder what the others have- or don’t have- compared to Zyn. Kind of like Rogue. What does that have that irritates some people’s gums like no other? Of all the brands I’ve tried, nothing hits like an American Zyn. I’m beyond feeling much of a nic buzz anymore, but I can tell when something kicks in.

08/22/2024 22:40,I started doing some research about the chemical compound of the few other chemicals that are in then and I've something to do with a salt that increases the nicotine absorption and release it's assault I think that they're not allowed to use in Europe. but they can use in America it's not carcinogenic or anything it comes down to regulatory standards but I found a channel called Snus  at home on YouTube and obviously it tells you what you can make but he was talking something about how I can't remember it's you it's either something to do with the alkaline or the salt that increases the nicotine absorption rate quicker and he said if you add too much you'll get a huge rush real quick so now I'm looking into possibly making my own Zyn sort of thing at home and adding a little extra of the salt to get a quicker hit I'm not sure but I think the salt is ammonium chloride,1,American Zyn nicotine pouches have to have something else in them

10/12/2023 17:53,"27F here. Throughout high school I was a casual cigarette smoker. I would typically have a pack last me a week. Probably around 2017 I tried juul for the first time and instantly loved it. Over the next four years the amount of pods I was using per day drastically went up. I’m a recovering drug addict so nicotine and caffeine are my only vices. I stopped using alcohol and drugs and I ended up getting to a point where I was going through four pods a day. I literally felt like I was still doing hard drugs. I would have pods that I was done with and when I ran out if I couldn’t immediately go to the store I would just go back to the empty pods and use those, literally so cringe. My coworker introduced me to zyn one day. I wasn’t necessarily interested in quitting vaping in terms of health reasons I really just wanted to stop because of the financial burden going through four pods daily. So zyn was perfect for me.I was using zyn for about 2 years at this point. It was March of this year and I noticed my throat had a tickle in it and I was always having to clear mucus out of my throat and I attributed it to the allergy season starting. It wasn’t until July that I decided to go to the doctor because the constant irritation in my throat had gotten so bad. Originally they thought allergies and gave me singulair which did nothing. Then they tried prednisone and antibiotics thinking maybe I had inflammation or an infection. That also didn’t work. I finally went to an ear nose throat doctor and he put me on pantoprazole thinking it’s gastric reflux. He said it can take up to two months to take effect (it’s been 3 weeks and no changes). It was always in the back of my head this may have to do with using zyn. It’s gotten so irritating and gives me anxiety always having this feeling in my throat. So I started using the patch. Initially I put it on my arm and it was so itchy I could barely handle it. Next day I put it on my stomach and that’s been way more manageable. It’s been 8 days since I’ve used zyn and the patch has helped me a lot. My throat is still bad so I really don’t know if the two are related. Either way I’m going to continue treatment with my doctor and continue the patch until I’m done with nicotine for good. So my question is if anyone has had any similar experiences to me?",6,Anyone else have throat pain/irritation?
10/12/2023 21:02,"I disagree with the other comment, i think the burning in your throat from nicotine pouches is not typically acid reflux, it is the nicotine itself irritating your throat. I find that some pouches do it worse than others, and zyns are some of the harshest in that regard. Pouches that are milder are lucy, nic-s,  sesh, and to a lesser extent velo. The best solution I can recommend is swallowing your spit with a bit of water when you have a pouch in, as it goes down easier and doesn’t burn on the way down. Or even better is just spitting your salive if the situation allows, that way you dont swallow it to burn in your throat",5,Anyone else have throat pain/irritation?

03/11/2024 14:41,"Very similar story. Quit smoking and went to vaping. After a few years of sucking the pods down it got old and was spending way to much money on them. About 2 months ago I went cold turkey vaping and straight to zyns.So now I have a zyn in pretty much constantly and fall asleep with them in my mouth a lot.Last Thursday I woke up and it hurt to swallow. 4 days go by same thing increasingly painful but always went away during the day. Monday It didn't go away, Tuesday my throat was so red, swollen and hurt so bad I had to goto the doctor. Checked for strep but it was negitive. Said it looked bad though and was pretty sure it was strep so he gave me antibiotics anyways.The antibiotics absolutely helped and definitely got better. However I'm pretty sure it wasn't strep and there was another bacterial thing going on. It's now the following Monday and I'm still on the antibiotics BUT my throat is now feeling the exact same it did the first day again. Woke up sore with a little tingle/itch/soreness. Wtf.Soooo I had a suspicion it could be the zyn causing this and came to see if it anyone else was having similar issues.Thanks for posting.",1,Anyone else have throat pain/irritation?

My fiancé finally said, it’s probably your Zyn pouches and it makes sense. Negative for strep, they tried to say allergies, started on allergy meds but no change. I was scared to tell my doctor I started using nicotine pouches because she helped me quit vaping, I was using nicotine gum and almost kicked the habit completely, then I started pouches and didn’t want to say anything to her about it.

They also cause cancer cells to reproduce 7 times faster (recent study just done). Don't do any of this poison. Drink coffee, suck on jolly ranchers, run in the morning to get high and slam water.

Some variants of sweeteners, mainly the older compounds, are known to cause this issue more than modern alternatives and why older variants aren't used much (but might if company is cutting corners, ie cheapies) - all the other stuff you say 'from a recent study', mind you that was a single 'study' and does not mean 100 ppl studied is universal. The same crap was happening with vapes, studies funded by cigarette company-sponsored labs. Turns out it's a wash. Zyns have like 3 ingredients - cellulose (which you eat all the time anyway), sweetener, and nicotine salts (pure chemical nicotine that's highly bioavailable, arguably healthier than tobacco extracted nic that would have traces of other compounds in it). It honestly couldn't get much safer. If you cut out all sugary crap (that guaranteed has artificial sweeteners in it), how much artificial sweetener would you really be getting with a few zyn pouches a day? How much in your toothpaste?

I feel 10 times better after quitting and my stomach is back in tip top and I still slam pizza and drink beer. It was 100% the zyn poison bullshit causing the issues with my stomach ( a horrifying burning pain). Actually, I think the article was taken down because I cannot find it. I swear they took it down on purpose lol. It was a kid who had horrible burning pain caused by Zyn. Stopped it and was good. Same experience as many others lol. we dont know for sure whats in it. And those artificial sweeteners are pure shit. plenty of studies on the Ace K sweetener and how it effects the gut. Well guess what, Zyn has Ace K and Aspartame. Double whammy.

04/10/2024 18:04,"So the other day I hit the gym before and after work. I don't like to use nicotine before the gym bc it frys your dopamine and reduces your blood flow which just seems stupid to do before a gym sesh. But anyway, I don't like to use a pouch before I eat either bc it messes with my appetite and I have to eat a lot to bulk up. So by the time I worked out, went to work, worked out again and ate my dinner, i had gone like 20 hours without nicotine. So I was wondering if that one zyn pouch after 20 hours completely resets my cravings and tolerance? For example, would my tolerance and the amount of cravings the day after consuming 1 nicotine pouch vs 10 pouches be the same if I consumed my last zyn pouch at the same time? Hopefully I'm phrasing that in a way that's understandable. But let me know if you have answer, I'm curious. ",0,Does nicotine tolerance build up to 100% after your first pouch in 18 hours?

06/08/2024 00:25,"I wouldnt smoke a whole blunt if you have no tolerance. When I started facing blunts to myself I would roll up maybe a gram and cut it in half, save the other half for another time. A good blunt gives you a strong and euphoric long lasting high best in the evening. I would wait till after dark because I'd start bugging a little before I was more experienced but I'd calm myself down and thoroughly enjoy it. Idk if it's the nicotine but the tobacco has more than that, it gives you a different buzz but I would say that it blends together nicely. 50/50 spliffs are more likely to give you a crazy headrush because there is a lot more tobacco.edit: forgot to add, do not quote me on this, officially they have to have warnings that it can kill you, but I don't think the occasional cigar even is bad as long as it's not a daily habit. People addicted to smoking tobacco smoke like 10x more than a pot smoker. If your tobacco use is relatively less than your weed, it's probably fine as long as it's not always mixed in.

07/30/2024 07:35,I've been using nicotine pouches for around 4 months now. Average 1-3 3mg ZYN pouches a day to help me focus while working. I always place them under my upper lip and alternate sides in hopes of reducing any gum damage. Despite this I recently gained some sort of abrasion on my gums but on the bottom of my mouth where I never place the pouches. Its possible its being caused by something else but I'm curious if anyone here has experienced something similar? Maybe the saliva from the nicotine is irritating an underling condition on that part of my gums I'm not aware of? In my research I've seen people have issues with gum damage due to nicotine pouches but I mostly see it with putting them in the same spot for too long and at a much higher rate of use.,1,Gum irritation not where I place pouches

I have 2-3 mouth ulcers that go away daily, im really afraid of this constant irritation of my gums, i've bought my first can 4 days ago, i use 4-5 pouches a day (12,8mg/pouch)I smoked for 1 year, did heets and vaping constantly for 2 years, never had gum problem. (not against nicotine pouches, i really do like them but i have some problems right now with them.)Before using Nicotine pouches, i never ever had problems with my gum, ulcers, and i never even had cavities, i brush 3 times a day, my dentist always said i have perfect teeth/gums but now they are a little bit red where i put them, before this they were pink/slightly reddish. Now they are RED where i put them .But now, my teeths are a little bit sensitive, not really irritating but i noticed it, my gums are a little bit sore, i always rotate my pouches but still.And probably the worst is my stomach, i have stomach cramps because of nic pouches. Im gonna start using them but i will never swallow them.Im really debating if this is normal, and this constant irritation wont cause problems like cancers and such.I KNOW that nicotine doesnt cause cancer, but its not that, its the constant irritation where you put your pouches, THAT can cause cancer.My dentist said, when you put these pouches into your gum over and over again and you are irritating them, they will go under mutation, and that may predispose or directly cause an oral cancer, from that repititve damage, and nic salts are very irritating to the gums. And he said its called, squamous cell carcinoma related cancers. Its not the nicotine, that causes cancer,  its the POUCH and the nicotine combined  that irritates your gum tissue. There's a foreign body in your gum line every single day.  He said 90% of gum cancers starts liket that. Irritation. Take this as you will, almost everyone on this sub is nicotine pouch fanatic, i truly do understand that, it looks like this is the most safest way to consume nicotine, sadly i use them daily too,  but theres a risk still to cancer as i stated above. And im not a beginner, in terms of using nicotine, smoked and vaped a lot sadly before this. it was like this Smoking then IQOS then VAPING and now, Nicotine Pouches.

05/10/2024 14:50,"I run a small hedge fund based out of Raleigh, NC. Myself and my Fund are long $HAYPP. Please see the disclaimer at the bottom of the post. For more blog posts like this check out my Fund's blog at [https://www.rogue-funds.com/blog](https://www.rogue-funds.com/blog)*All Financial Figures are in USD unless otherwise specified.*I think HAYPP Group, the biggest online retailer of nicotine pouches, can capture a huge chunk of the sales in what I believe will be the biggest form of nicotine intake growth over the next 10-15 years.The future of nicotine consumption will be nicotine pouches and it is growing at an unprecedented rate. Here in the States the go to item for nicotine pouches are Zyn’s (owned by Philip Morris), in Europe it’s Velo (owned by British American Tobacco), but there are various other brands that all catching fire: ON! (Altria), Rogue, Juice Head, FRE, Lucy, and Sesh, among various others.**What is HAYPP?***Brief History*HAYPP is an online retailer and distributor of nicotine pouches and snus. The company was started by a couple of Swedish teenagers in 2009 and through mergers and acquisitions they no longer are in charge of the company as the current CEO joined in 2017/2018. The company bought Nicokick.com and northerner.com (northerner owns 9% of stock) which are now both of their main American brands. They switched from Snus to Nicotine Pouches 6 years ago and haven’t looked back.[Domains Owned By HAYPP Group](https://preview.redd.it/gr3kxwm5anzc1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=383bb5d7ac692fe7323192c608ae812b46f4e7c1)HAYPP currently owns a roughly 85% online market share for their Nordic part of the business, which they refer to as their “core” business as well as a \~55% market share of the oral nicotine market (85% market share of the nicotine pouch e-commerce market) for their growth market which is considered the US, UK, Germany, and Swiss countries.[Market Share of HAYPP](https://preview.redd.it/r9y53fg7anzc1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b11912ca8e532bc15d9b2d918bc4fa2673c3a917)[HAYPP vs Closest Competitor in each Market](https://preview.redd.it/dsu4sxm8anzc1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82be786825f001a4617db95ea6b88795b16aaeb0)*SEO Powerhouse*So how do they have such a grasp on what would obviously be a hyper competitive online industry? The main reason for their hyper success in the online market is that they have a death grip on the SEO landscape. Their mastery of SEO allows them to spend almost nothing on marketing and to keep pushing out their distribution system (which continues to drive costs down for them and consumers). This creates a positive feedback loop as they become even cheaper than their competitors, allowing them to lock in customers (over 90% of the customers becoming recurring customers).[How Consumers find HAYPP](https://preview.redd.it/qevmp0qaanzc1.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad031f2035197c31f321a03926d954b33f2357b4)[HAYPP Marketing Expenses as a &amp;#37; of Sales](https://preview.redd.it/fru8h8xbanzc1.png?width=683&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a9e6014be0a78d76582c962afb0219ebfd53778)If you google just about anything related to Nicotine pouches, there is probably a 95%+ chance that the top unpaid search result will be a HAYPP Group Domain. Even niche searches such as “what is an upper decky” (Gen. Z slang for nicotine pouches) or basic searches such as “what are the top nicotine pouches” you will see that HAYPP Group owns the top of the search.https://preview.redd.it/e7ocu0jdanzc1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8e80b8d743de3dc9133504bd6ff85dbbaee48bb[Google Searches Highlighting the SEO power of HAYPP](https://preview.redd.it/symd8zueanzc1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=176783915281075fdb07a1b83ee6b18f2978f24c)This is huge when sites like Google severely limit the amount of advertising that addictive products can utilize on their search engine. HAYPP ends up barely spending anything on marketing due to 40% of new customers coming through word of mouth and the rest from SEO.*Data*Their other field of expertise is data collection and selling. Due to the large variety of pouches and being the number one online seller of nicotine pouches, they have created a major database which they sell to various nicotine pouch producers such as Philip Morris and Altria. Producers buy these on an annualized basis, and you can see the usage of their data among the investor relation reports/presentations/websites of various producers. As you can see from my beautiful pictures on this post, they compile plenty of data to help me understand the business better. *Lowest Cost Seller and Best E-Commerce Distribution*Due to their distribution network, HAYPP has become one of the cheapest (if not the cheapest) sellers of nicotine pouches in the world. You can buy Zyn’s cheaper from HAYPP websites than you can from the ZYN website. Haypp’s prices are 20-40% cheaper than grocery stores and 30-50% cheaper than convenience stores.They have been integrating their distribution network so that most variable costs are being converted to vertical fixed costs creating operating leverage for them as they rapidly scale their revenue and are able to increase margins. They have implemented 2-day delivery across the US and close to implementing across Europe markets as well.https://preview.redd.it/0sajvfgkanzc1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3aad16b9df1be7bf6bbcc8f16ebf8c469c15b3a0[HAYPP Distribution](https://preview.redd.it/cbanlyvlanzc1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=537d2414b3c56538902bbf1594f78fe77b44f089)*Leveraging Market Share for High Quality New Products*The last part of their business model is their ability to leverage their large consumer base to help new products capture market share, which allows them to capture higher margins on their products and it increases the variety of products which consumers would like to buy. In Nordic countries the variety of products is a benefit to them as consumers want to try various brands and flavors. When this competition trend hits the US it will only benefit them even more. **Why Haypp vs Pouch Companies**Currently in the US there are only a couple main brands with Zyn owning a huge chunk of the market. In Europe, Velo is the most popular brand but there are many Nordic brands that consistently attack margins and currently there is little competition in the US market which most likely won’t last much longer. As consumers search out the cheapest product and try to hunt for variety, HAYPP will be that future as convenience stores lag in variety and cost.Products such as Zyn will definitely continue to grow (currently Zyn is growing at 70% y/y) but we could see margins shrink as competition becomes fiercer and consumers branch out away from the first movers, although Zyn continues to take up 70% of the US market. This only further benefits HAYPP as they are the go-to spot for a large amount of variety. Although they don’t benefit as much from less competition, they are still beneficiaries of an oligopoly esque market due to their cost and distribution networks.Most large publicly traded pouch companies are also cigarette and chewing tobacco sellers who are rapidly seeing those segments get cannibalized by vaping and nicotine pouches combined with regulatory crackdown risk. Since HAYPP has no exposure to either one, you will not experience any cannibalization outside of snus cannibalization in the Nordics. This is the best pure play bet on nicotine pouch consumption.Certain countries have limited the ability for consumers to have access to nicotine via retail stores which will allow them to take huge shares of the overall market in places like Germany or in California where they have banned flavored nicotine products in retail stores has led to windfall of customers to HAYPP’s e-commerce model. **Management**The current CEO of HAYPP group, Gavin O’Dowd, used to work for British American Tobacco (BAT) and was the driving force for the VELO acquisition. He currently owns 3.6% of the stock and various other PE firms and Family Offices own large chunks of HAYPP. Most executives have warrants that could give them the right to 200k-400k shares each (29m shares outstanding with no serious history of dilution). **Regulations**As many of you are aware, regulations are a huge part of the nicotine industry. Taxes are going to be huge risks, which are then combined with flavor bans. I think nicotine pouches are one of the products that are least likely to get hit with serious bans since their health risk is much lower than almost any other nicotine product.The nicotine pouch industry as a whole has been behaving spectacularly well when it comes to ensuring they are not purposefully marketing to young people. They are trying to avoid having a Juul 2.0 fiasco which basically murdered that business and completely fragmented the vaping industry which is on the brink of regulatory crack down.HAYPP does their part by ensuring age regulation across their whole site. They have age verification to order and deliver. They have a huge emphasis on ensuring that they abide by the law. **Financials***Core Segment (Nordic Countries)*The company is growing heavily in every segment that it operates in. Its core segment seems to be slowing down in growth due to heavy cannibalization from snus sales. This should only be temporary as nicotine pouch volume grows at 30%+ y/y. Once snus nears its cannibalization endpoint, I would expect revenue to begin growing again in its core market (although not at 30%). Current revenue is $250m USD and EBITDA is about $18m USD for just the core segment for the last twelve months. Management expects high single digit EBITDA margins for 2025.[Core Segment Sales and EBITDA Margin](https://preview.redd.it/yzcdzgtoanzc1.png?width=526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b25fafa6bcdf821a4a36de2cafa09aaa625b67bf)*Growth Segment (US, UK, Germany, Switzerland)*The growth segment is skyrocketing. Growth is over 46% y/y and this growth has been consistent and should continue to be consistent. EBITDA margin for the growth markets has begun to inflect positively which will cause a massive amount of leverage in their EBITDA to occur as their fixed cost model begins to do its job. As economies of scale drive forward, we should see this margin increase substantially over the coming years. Currently Revenue is at $77m USD for growth markets and EBITDA is at -$3.5m USD.[Growth Segment Sales and EBITDA Margin](https://preview.redd.it/5dwt225qanzc1.png?width=515&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09f25d4e92c17667ae4129e1d28e0b3a0be59a9b)*Let’s Talk about the Growth Segment a bit more.*This is where the real value from HAYPP will come into play. While it currently begins to inflect positive in terms of profitability, it should be noted that the Growth markets have a massive TAM compared to their core market and could cause the company to 5x in the next few years if they maintain or gain market share and continue to grow in these massive TAMs.*Total TAM growth*As they grow, their competitive advantage deepens due to sticky customers and cheaper products from economies of scale. The US has an even faster scale of 49%+ growth y/y and HAYPP is outpacing the US nicotine pouch growth at 57% y/y. As the US begins to approve various products and variety begins to flood the US market, a ton of US users want to try various Nordic brands that don’t have access which lends a very strong lean towards an online website such as HAYPP. The US is a very ripe environment along with the UK and Germany (where nicotine can only be sold online) for HAYPP to continue to outperform massively.*Emerging Segment*Their “emerging” segment is where they have begun to introduce vapes into their value chain. HAYPP is beginning to sell vapes to UK and Germany, but it is at the very beginning stages and has no current significant impact on their bottom or top line. The company says the growth they are experiencing in this segment has been very similar to the growth that they experienced when they introduced Nicotine Pouches in growth markets. This is the most likely segment to get hit with regulatory concerns, so for now I won’t even consider this in a to be a profitable unit and will just assume it will be a small drain on EBITDA for the foreseeable future.*Balance Sheet*The balance sheet is great with no large debt burden and good working capital management. As they hit profitability this year/early next year I would expect a cash build up until the company decides if they will be returning cash to shareholders or reinvesting in the business. **Valuation**HAYPP is extremely undervalued based on where they are from a profitability standpoint and their current inflection point. Due to their high growth, it will be hard to pinpoint an exact value on them so this will merely be an exercise in estimating their value among a range more than usual (anyone who claims they can perfectly value a high growth company is probably overvaluing due to unsound conviction). First let’s look at how they are currently valued, which is roughly 14x their **core** EBITDA. Now let’s take a second and think about how insane that statement was. Their core market is the Nordic countries which will be hitting growth again as their snus cannibalization slows, the Nordic countries basically have no further regulation risk for nicotine pouches, and it is a noncyclical industry. I would argue that 14x their core EBITDA is probably an appropriate valuation based on **only** their core segment.What this means is (if you haven’t noticed already) that you are getting their “growth” segment for **free** based on the valuation of the stock. The growth segment alone is probably worth multiples of the current stock price due to the massive TAM and extreme growth prospects. If we assume the emerging segment is worthless (which it isn’t and it will be profitable at some point) then that means all of the upside in the stock can be based on what the value of the growth segment. Based on TAM, growth, and lack of cyclicality then this leaves the only risk as regulation.There will most likely be some sort of regulation, but we are very far from that as the Tobacco industry has been very careful in how they implement their new nicotine pouch momentum in a more appropriate way compared to vapes. The most likely regulations will probably be flavor bans of some sort or retail bans (which further benefits HAYPP). Regulations will most likely be limited in scope due to just the sheer lack of mortality risk associated with pouches vs any other form of common nicotine intake.Based on their probable conservative revenue growth (40% average for the next 3 years, and 15% after that), EBITDA growth, the fact that they will have both core and growth markets at high single digit EBITDA margins in 2025, and their lack of cyclicality, then I would estimate that their Growth markets are worth a very conservative $400m-$500m USD. I am likely undershooting the valuation because they are driving profitability very fast and their revenue is growing closer to 40%-60% in growth markets right now. If they are able to keep up current growth figures and expand to double digit margins before the end of the decade then they could be worth 2x-3x this value (which is why valuing growth companies are so hard, because I can’t foresee the future). Again, I valued the emerging segment as worthless which is unlikely as well.So, based on the value of $450m USD for the growth markets and the current value of $240 USD for the Nordic markets, that would create a sum of the parts equal to roughly $700m or nearly triple the current share price. This valuation leaves a ton of room for margin expansion and higher growth prospects because let’s face it, the US alone is probably worth at least 3x-5x more than the Nordic countries not including the UK, Germany, or Swiss. This is a very conservative valuation for the company, but it shows how great the risk/reward is based on the current price. Using a conservative valuation here also helps accommodate for regulation risk.In SEK terms this would be 250 SEK/share or 7.35B SEK.**Conclusion**Even accommodating for regulation risk, a valuation of $700m seems appropriate as a starting point for the valuation for HAYPP Group. I think there is a very high likelihood that I could be off on this by a large margin, but I feel like the downside is very protected with this valuation. Management has been great in execution and I expect that to continue. In a more bullish case where every segment of the company fires on all cylinders we could see a valuation of $1.5B+, but that is not a scenario that I would like to bet my investors’ money on. For now, I will stay invested and keep watching them execute and adjust my valuation accordingly.*Disclaimer: The author of this idea and his Fund have a position in securities discussed at the time of posting and may trade in and out of this position without informing the reader.**Opinions expressed herein by the author are not an investment recommendation and are not meant to be relied upon in investment decisions.

05/23/2024 09:11,"Apart from the Easy Way suggestions, which is totally the way to go. Mindfullness smoking also helps. When smoking, don't do anything but smoke. Just sit there, don't scroll on your phone. Just be present with you and the smoke, when the mind wanders, bring it back to the act of smoking, how the smoke goes into the lungs, the taste of the smoke, the effect. Most smokers ""smoke"" while doing other stuff, including socializing, taking a break, on the phone, playing games. The ""cigarette demon"" as I coined it during my quitting process, loves you focusing on other things while you smoke, this way it can embed itself under the notion of ""I smoke to relax, I smoke to remove stress, I smoke because I like it"" etc. When you become wholly mindful of smoking, you actually begin to see how all of these reasons aren't really true, they are the result of all these other acts you do while smoking. Smoking only alleviates the anxiety it creates and nothing more. That anxiety at most lasts 15 minutes. When you become a mindful smoker, you'll realize all of this and it becomes easier to starve the cigarette demon. And it feels good watching that demon squirm.",1,How the F do I quit smoking?

I used to hate cigarettes because they abused the gift of tobacco and now I abandoned my own position to Zyn up so I can work harder during the day.Now that I have a Zyn habit if I have a pipe or a cigar I still pop one in right after and I’m not enjoying the smoke, I’m annoyed it didn’t “get me there.” Screw the abuse of nicotine.

I don't smoke the pipe for vitamin N, I smoke it primarily for the flavors, with nicotine's relaxing effect a positive side effect. If I put on some lively yet contemplative music (mandolin music pairs really well), it gets me in the mood to enjoy the flavors and the act of smoking a pipe.

06/26/2024 08:55,"the last two semesters have ruined my (23F) mental state. my professors were very, very kind giving me extensions after the semesters ended so i could turn in work and get a better grade. usually professors are hesitant to accept a request for an incomplete and i completely understand because i’m apart of the problem. i wait until the last minute. my second semester, i got an extension in two classes. one of them i just didn’t do the work. my textbook subscription expired and i didn’t know it until i tried to actually attempt the work. i don’t have that kind of money. the second class i wrote three papers in a day. i got good grades and passed but jesus… last semester i got incomplete for two classes again. i try to access the online lessons but again my subscription expired. luckily i averaged a high C on all my exams so i passed the class even without the online assignments. the class i’m trying to complete in the next two days has been so much easier than i thought and i’m just angry with myself. seven discussion boards and two more to do and a paper. i was diagnosed with adhd in the middle of spring semester and i’m working to seek out medicine. i wish i had more control over my brain but it’s impossible unless i’m even in the mood to be actively productive. luckily, i finished ten assignments in the past five hours and i have two days to write my last paper, which was actually according to plan… but i’m still ashamed of myself. i had a month to do all of this. my question is if anyone with adhd could chime in on ways to trick my brain to be better while i search for medicine. planners kind of work, i hate lists but (as i’ve learned five hours ago) they’re useful. but how can i mentally motivate myself that isn’t anxiety and dread? like actively do my part and complete my assignments without self-sabotaging?

06/26/2024 10:34,"For me, it was a matter of figuring out what to do with the crappy feeling. IMO, feeling bad about waiting too long or showing up to class with an unfinished assignment is a sign that you need to make a change, if you want to avoid that feeling (I decided I do).So I dedicated time to block out distractions and work on whatever the upcoming assignment is, and created my own deadlines ahead of the real turn-in dates. I took frequent breaks (literally 20 mins working, 10-15 mins goofing off at first) to reinforce the separation of work time vs idle time. That way it doesn't seem like you spin wheels for 6 hours working on a paper when you're really watching tiktok, texting friends back immediately, scanning news that popped up, or any other time-wasting attention grabs.I got so good at meeting my own pre-deadlines that I'd have stuff done way ahead, and then I could move on to something else or make minor adjustments I thought of before turning in (on time!).Most of all, I like the feeling of being ahead and the calmness of having things done and turned in vs the awful anxiety of stuff piling up and having to pull all-nighters. Then when classes get really tense at the end of the semester it's not overwhelming.Medication definitely helps with adhd, of course. But there are some habit changes you can help accommodate it too.",17,i think i disappoint my professors
06/26/2024 17:16,"You're amazing. Putting earlier deadlines for one's self is of course the golden key to being on time. I always did that. I procrastinate about some things - but not schoolwork/work. I too like the calmness (although I can still get myself worked up with wanting do to last minute revisions; I store my various revisions in a folder with each tiny change shown; I do this to try and convince myself that some of my last minute changes are not all that urgent). I also try to make due dates in my own classes a bit ahead of the Big Hitter classes (like, say Chem 101). I teach electives (Human Biology; Human Sexuality; Bio Anth). I don't want my deadlines interfering with a student's ability to focus on their core course of study.",4,i think i disappoint my professors

06/26/2024 09:29,"I can’t speak for other professors, but I don’t think I’ve ever been disappointed in a student. I create opportunities- take them or leave them. I’ve been quite friendly with kids who didn’t pass my class because they were cool, friendly people; I don’t shut them down because they didn’t do school work.

I usually tell students in these situation that it happens to everyone, at one time or another (heck, I've been known to ignore manager badgering to do some stupid training and have been put on the Naughty list - but as a tenured person, there's nothing they can really do except make me feel childish). I also tell all my classes the truth: I know people who got into very good med schools with one or two C's in a pre-med class. It happens quite a bit. I sat on the med school admissions committee at one school and there were so many other factors to consider. A lower division ""C"" is nothing.

Sometimes, they will have free codes or even physical textbooks. I get multiple textbooks sent to me to review for my class for free. If I end up using the book, I keep it and if a students needs it, I let them have borrow it or have it.I also will, uh… definitely not, uhh… recommend an onion type thing and something something lib gen… er.. something.

06/26/2024 20:16,"That works! I usually avoid outlines because it becomes too cumbersome and tedious as my outline essentially turns into my essay without being my essay (idk if that makes sense). I only use outlines to collect my general thoughts and put down my quotes and resources from my research under general subtitles. Another thing I do is save your dirty laundry to do for when you really need/want to do a homework sesh, that way you’ll have a reason to stay out of a place of pure comfort and be productive, this way you can better ensure that you’re getting your homework done AND completing other mundane tasks like laundry or dishes. One other thing I do is, at the beginning of the term, write down on a notepad (legal writing pad), in different colors, every assignment due and when they’re due along with their score values, and I do this for each class. This way I can satisfy my OCD and organizational desires and distract myself from any anxiety and stress I might be feeling or experiencing from other parts of my life.

06/26/2024 20:59,i understand what you mean about the outline turning into the essay. i guess i work the opposite lol. my essays always start as outlines. i’ll fill it with all my thoughts on the topic and when i have a pretty big chunk (1 page of *stuff*)  finished i’ll go back and edit it to make sense. it’s kind of therapeutic to me though. funny you bring up the laundry thing because i currently have to wash everything so it has kept me inside.i loved using colored highlighters in my notices but i never thought to use them on a grading chart like that. i like that!,2,i think i disappoint my professors

06/26/2024 19:01,"About 10 years ago, I went to college and couldn't handle school. I just couldn't show up to class, keep track of assignments, etc... I was miserable. I hated it. I'm very smart, but school just wasn't what I wanted. So I took a break.Last fall, I finished the last semester of my associates degree after having an over 7 year break (I did a full contract in the Army Infantry, then went to automotive technical school and worked in that field for 2.5 years). I made Dean's List that semester with over 95% in all of my 4 classes.At the time, I was undiagnosed and unmedicated for ADHD. I was diagnosed about 2 months after I graduated with my associates. Now, I'm getting my bachelor's in engineering.If you have ADHD, you have to *want* to do it. REALLY want to do it. If you're struggling in school right now, ask yourself if college is really what you want. There is absolutely no shame in taking a step back to reevaluate your choices and find a different path. If you're set on finishing your degree, which I encourage, you need to completely go against your ADHD urges. It starts with showing up to class every single day without fail (early!) and doing your homework until all of it is done. If you do just those 2 things, I promise you, your grades will handle themselves and you won't have half as much stress. Again, I also have ADHD. I 1000% relate to you on this.",3,i think i disappoint my professors

Show up to class every day, pay attention to the lectures (sit at the front row of every class right in front of the professor. Trust me, this is key to focusing), and do all the homework. That's it. It will make a world of a difference. You CAN do it. You are totally capable of not only passing, but excelling. Don't just *be* a [insert profession here]. Be the BEST [insert profession here].

The moisture content of FRĒ allows for both the flavor and the active ingredients to release through the pores of the pouch more efficiently.

I'm sure you're well aware of the addiction potential of nicotine, you don't need 10+ people telling you using gum = crippling addiction. Are you immune to addiction? No. That doesn't mean you can't utilize nicotine responsibly like any other drug. Take days off, follow a protocol, don't chew more than 1-2 a day. Not everyone succumbs to addiction and if any of you knew what you were talking about there wouldn't be so many of you saying stupid shit like ""the dumbest thing I've seen on Reddit is someone using nicotine gum as a nootropic"" even tho it possesses enormous nootropic value and you're the one who couldn't moderate your use.

I guess they are comparing it to cigarettes, but cigs have a MAOI cocktail and other psychoactives, it's definitely not just nicotine.

10/01/2018 11:56,"There seems to be quite a few people saying nicotine's pretty addictive, but in my experience it's certainly not the case. I've been trying it for over 4 months now, and had a period where I (experimentally) took 1–2 doses of 1mg per day for just under a month. Throughout these trials, I only noticed a slight drop in quality of sleep, and 2 days of mildly decreased mood when stopping (which could've simply been coincidental). I also noticed no development of tolerance even when taking daily, so that shouldn't be an issue.Now I just take it once every week or two in ~0.8mg doses sublingually, and have zero problems with it and haven't noticed any kind of addiction forming. My advice would be to set a schedule or limit for taking it (eg. no more than twice a week) and to never go over the decided limit — otherwise, as others have suggested, you may begin to develop a tolerance and end up forming an addiction to the substance.",4,"Just tried some nicotine gum, pretty impressive"
10/01/2018 13:23,"I said that for years. Now I’m fully addicted to nicotine pouches. I started with gum then my friends had me try dip. I used that super sparingly before I’d go out because it made me feel great. Then the good feelings went away and progressed into a can a day chew habit. Quit the tobacco a year ago but I have a solid habit of spending $7 a day on these fucking cans of nicotine powder pouches that I have to have in my mouth all day. Better than the cancer risk from chewing tobacco but it’s an expensive habit. I have the gum, which is fine, but at the amount I need it gives me pretty bad stomach discomfort due to the erythritol. The pouches are 6mg each so assuming that’s true and if I actually absorb all of it, that’s 90mg a day.I don’t even like it anymore. But the cravings are weird as fuck and real.

I rarely/practically never take it for recreational purposes, and use it purely just for studying and infrequent focus-oriented tasks. The amount you take per dose also seems to vary the effects you receive from it — anything under ~1.2mg (my typical dose being ~0.8mg) feels mostly stimulating and not really pleasurable, although past the 1mg mark the relaxation effects are more prominent. That being said, maybe I'm an outlier as I find the headrush from higher doses to be really uncomfortable.

If the cost is an issue, you could try taking nicotine the way I do: simply taking 2 drops of diluted pure nicotine vape liquid (18mg/mL) sublingually, although the taste can be pretty repulsive and perhaps a little dangerous as you'd need to accurately measure and calculate doses. I've heard of people creating their own sprays, lozenges and patches, but they seem too much effort and risk, for me at least, as I rarely use it.I appreciate the caution and personal insight though, hopefully by carefully logging and monitoring my doses the same won't happen to me.",1,"Just tried some nicotine gum, pretty impressive"

I tried the Apple Ice Breakers and thought they seemed pretty good but would be better without the flavor pack in them. Btw these Breakers said ""Made in Sweden"" on the cans.So I got on Nicokick and placed my first order ever. I went with 4mg Cinnamon, 4mg Wintergreen and 4mg  Apple Ice. I got 11 of them altogether and even added 3 of the 4mg Sesh Wintergreen. They arrived today and I see they are Made in China on the side, but they looked ok. Wrong. The Cinnamon and Wintergreen have the same awful flavor to them. Cinnamon tastes nothing like Cinnamon. Wintergreen had that off flavor with a hint of wintergreen being overpowered by it. The Apple Ice seemed ok didn't notice this off flavor to them they are just super fruity.Personally I feel like they are a waste of money. American Zyn are better than this. They hit hard though imo.

07/26/2024 14:28,A whole number of factors could cause that.Hunger level. Hydration level. Lung capacity. Tolerance to hookah itself. Even mood or current state of mind. Can't pinpoint it.,6,no buzz?
07/26/2024 14:29,I’ve gotten a buzz off hookah a handful of times in my life and I don’t even smoke it often.,2,no buzz?
07/28/2024 05:04,"Hi.As OrdinaryArcher5006 and Few-Macaroon2936 already wrote, it really can depend on a lot of factors.If I were you, I would try experimenting with different preparations of tobacco for the bowl.Hookah is supposed to be about a friendly hookah session. Someone can tolerate more, someone less, everyone smokes the way they want. Etiquette for hookahs also exists (find it on Youtube). For example, the hookah hose should always be placed freely on the table. Whoever wants to smoke from the hose, takes the hose himself and smokes 1x-2x and then puts it back on the table. The hookah hose must not be given - there is a risk of gouging the eyes or other situations. There is more and it is simply the etiquette of serving hookahs, which few people know :-D. But enough about the conservative lifestyle.Try with your friends to find a common solution. For example, a hookah can be filled in such a way that if you draw smoke deep into your lungs with a large volume, you will feel dizzy. However, if you smoke less or only once and then rest for 2 minutes, your head should not spin. Well... and a smoker who needs more nicotine takes up to 3 puffs in a row from the hose.I recently started combining herbal + classic hookah tobacco together. That's because the nicotine-free herbal one has mint in it, and I don't have anything else with mint. So the combination of 30% mint (herbal manufacturer Tanya) + 70% cherry (Al Fakher standard hookah tobacco) means that if I smoke from the hose, I have to take 5-6 puffs to finally feel the nicotine in my body (and in my head) . However, a friend who can't even take 1/2 puff of smoke from the hose during normal hookah smoking, because he has a different nicotine tolerance, praises this. With new fillings of tobacco, my friend can take even 1 strong puff of smoke - into full lungs (once and then pause for 1-2 minutes).In the same way, the Al Fakher tobacco I mentioned, which belongs to the slightly drier types of hookah tobacco (there is not much glycerin), can be prepared as a strong, but also as a weak tobacco. If I use a traditional type of bowl, I fill 25g of tobacco using the fluffy method in this traditional bowl, I set a higher power of the heat source, so you can feel a really strong ""buzz effect"". However, if I fill Al Fakher as fluffy, in a bowl phunnel type, and when I use a HMD with a thick bottom plate, then the nicotine is barely perceptible. This is because the HMD in conjunction with the phunnel bowl works on the principle of evaporation of water vapor (glycerin - white dense clouds) and aroma (infused in glycerin), but the hot air only minimally gets through the tobacco layer (than in the case of the traditional type bowl).",1,no buzz?
08/13/2021 15:15,"**Read if you want, observations below** \- I don't think nicotine is all bad, and I'm generally hesitant to demonize most substances. I had a mixed habit (vapes, cigarettes, hookah, etc) for several years, and despite my addiction I did my best to make observations about the substance the same way I would any other. I quit cold turkey a while back and have tiptoed into low-dose patches for its nootropic effect recently. Ultimately, I think nicotine may actually be a viable ~~nootropic~~  cognitive enhancer if approached with EXTRAORDINARY caution and via specific ROAs. In my opinion it is one of the most addictive substances out there (moreso than even some of the nastier stimulants, at least for me) in smoked, vaped, and probably even sprayed forms. However, nicotine patches present a much, much more useful delivery system, providing the cognitive benefits of nicotine without the immediate euphoria. This avoids that immediate action-satisfaction response that makes it so powerfully addictive, and avoids associating that rapid release with other activities.If you do not use nicotine and want to try it as a nootropic, buy a SMALL (2 or 4-pack) of the lowest-dose (""step three"") patches. This will deliver 7mg over 24 hours. If after those first couple patches you find yourself inclined to buy more the next day (EVEN if you have a reasonable justification for it) DO NOT. If you find yourself inclined to buy a stronger patch for greater efficacy, DO NOT. If you want to foray into gum or spray, again purchase the lowest dose and the smallest quantity. It's generally advisable to pace yourself. Addiction does not necessarily care if you are smart. If you do use nicotine habitually, I honestly also recommend patches. At least for me, they basically zero out any cravings without doing any extra garbage to your system. If you're quitting or trialing and you'd like to ask anything about the substance, please let me know and I'll be happy to help.**The Bad (generally speaking, ymmv)*** It's ridiculously addictive in immediate-release forms. I've consumed my fair share of extremely dangerous substances, legal and otherwise, and nothing else has hooked me as quick and as hard as nicotine (except maybe caffeine, but caffeine is awesome and also makes my migraines go away and doesn't screw my brain as hard.)* It presents a cross-enhancement to the addictive powers of other substances, particularly stimulants. Associating the nicotine rush with other things happens quickly and subconsciously, and creates an inclination towards both nicotine and whatever other activity or substance you mix it with.* You can maintain control of a habit for quite a while (I was a once or twice low-concentration infrequent user and only used in specific circumstances for like 8 months), but complacency can still hook you.* Much like caffeine and other stimulants, it can burn you out if you use too much in a day or a short period. Just depletes the system eventually.* Nicotine's nootropic properties act in a dose-dependent u-curve. Too little and you'll think nothing of it, too much and you will experience the terrible nausea and headache that is acute nicotine sickness.* Withdrawals are absolutely fucking awful and last for quite a while. Some may avoid addiction and thus withdrawals with caution, but the safest route is to stick to caffeine or less stimmy noots.**The Good (in patch form, as I said other ROAs present too much risk IMO)*** I won't go over all the research here, but I've seen a couple good write-ups on it I can link in a moment on the hard science of what exactly nicotine does and why it's a good noot on paper.* The paced-out delivery of a patch means that it's viable for up to 24 hours, especially as an infrequent user. Better than the half-lives of most noots without explicitly re-dosing, as long as you get the patch on right lol. DON'T CUT PATCHES.* In this form, it provides a subtle stimulation, mild wakefulness enhancement, and decent focus improvement. The euphoria is mild to nonexistent (and if you experience more than a subtle euphoria you are using too much and wearing a patch longer than a few hours will likely make you feel bad)* It provides a decent complement to caffeine and a handful of other noots without being overpowering. I also find it easier and better to pace out // reduce my intake of caffeine with a patch on.**Other Notes*** Trying to sleep with a patch on might 1) keep you awake or 2) give you SUPER wild dreams. Not necessarily bad, but I don't sleep with patches on.* Picking good spots for a patch to stick and stay can be a pain. Inner arms are good if you don't sweat too much, and the central/lower chest usually works. Worst case, stick a bandaid or some medical tape around the edges. (Don't squeeze or fully cover patches though.)* I've combined it with everything under the sun, so if you're curious about particular combinations let me know. IMO it goes especially well with racetams and noopept.* I don't really endorse nicotine use. If you can use it effectively as a nootropic, it may show some benefit, but a serious nicotine habit is not worth it. Trust me.",117,Observations and insights about nicotine as a nootropic from a former addict - good and bad

Gonna try to figure out if it's like cutting open an extended release tablet or if it's just bullshit.EDIT: it's also worth noting that even if they do leak or are otherwise compromised, your worst-case scenario with lower-strength patches is probably some skin aggravation and a possibly unpleasant but not acutely unsafe amount of nicotine absorption.

08/13/2021 21:43,"If I can’t steer you from nicotine, a patch is by far, by far the best and least harmful.It’s not all about tar. Nicotine really does work on your cardiovascular system. Constricted blood vessels, and Stein that overtime hardens every vein, capillary, artery and so forth in your body.It makes your blood thicker, in restricted “plumbing”. Smoking tobacco introduces a synergistically harmful variable- that is extremely small particles which then really make thrombosis, stroke etc likely.E cigarettes don’t create tar. Or ammonia. But they still produce these ultra fine particles that team with nicotine’s general impact on the blood vessels.Addiction is verrry insidious. You might smoke daily for 5 years, and then exper once the first ever time where being out forced you to drive to the gas station. 4 years in you might swear the addiction passed you- or that free will saved you. Keep this in mind. Anecdotally, an e cig I used even knowing of the harm (and yes I too believed it safe until understanding the mechanisms which tobacco products induce disease… but nic salts are a ritual).Well they caused rapid gum recession… teeth hurt so bad I was going to get root canals. This was with any sweet or sour nic salt juice. My allergies may be part, but theres risk… cigarettes NEVER hurt my teeth or caused decay so fast it was actually noticeable Stick with a patch if you can. If you can quit, your mood, cognition, etc gets much better. It takes forever. Settle on a patch and you will be in relatively good shape though. No jonesing, still hard on your arteries but nothing like inhaling. Oral health is a big deal… it’s not just vanity- it his also is spared by patches.

Addictive though!Have stopped a couple of times but the last time it lasted 2-3 years. In that period I had terrible problems with my digestion, got some kind of IBS thingy, and a brain fog from hell. Severe troubles finding words, bad memory and always tired. I never connected it to me quitting nicotine though, not sure why except for a couple of symptoms having delayed onset.Tried a lot of noots trying to fix the brain fog and memory issues, but nothing really helped, although some were better than other (cdp-coline and alcar. oxiracetam to some degree).When corona hit I saw the case studies about smokers not getting as sick as the non-smokers and I got interested. I knew I didn't want to use tobacco again and bought a vape. Not liking it at all though. But for some reason I found a new kind of tobacco free snus, which basically is nicotine with some flavour added in a pouch you put under your lip. Started using it and I was back to my old self. Like magic =)I guess that my brain had down regulated my choline and dopamine system and even after 2 years it had not recovered. But starting nicotine again fixed it for me (yes, by using an addictive drug).But since the tobacco free nicotine pouches are almost harmless to your health, I'd rather live with my habit than trying to go trough years of trying to get my brain to recover.In the end I do think that nicotine is one of the better nootropics.

If I felt that patches were a regular sustainable thing for the effects I want, or if I slip and pick up a dependence again later in life I can see myself choosing to maintain it in the healthiest way possible rather than cutting it and dealing with the consequences, and I think we're fortunate to have that perspective among the nicotine-using population.It's my hope that this post presented a real-world overview of the substance for people who have seen more academic chatter about nicotine.Cheers!",3,Observations and insights about nicotine as a nootropic from a former addict - good and bad

I've tried things that have comparative addiction risks and had no issue walking away, perhaps in part to the understanding of addiction my nicotine habit gave me, but there's no guarantee that any conscious factor could steer you away from an dependence.Nicotine is a gnarly one for a lot of people, and the mixture of other substances as well as the delivery attributes of different ROAs mean that even best-case you're still rolling the dice.It is interesting that some people have no issue with it though, I'd be curious to if/how your experience of nicotine differs. Do you find that the typical effect profile described for whatever your ROA of choice is consistent with what you feel it does for you?

02/29/2024 04:36,"ב''ה, browsing here has me seeing what's around, apparently the gimmick with sesh is that they're ""chewing gum like"" to give a release more like.. literal chewing tobacco or gum?  So if they die quick apparently chewing is encouraged and if that works properly, instead of getting a your-actual-gumline-ruining mouth burning blast of nicotine at once, you can wait, give a careful chew on it, ""re-up"" off the same pouch and do that every 15-30 minutes or so until it's really exhausted or you're satisfied.  Interested in trying the Rogue gum for the same reason and because some no pouches workplaces are still okay with gum as it's a ""quitting"" product.",1,Good morning sesh with sesh

02/11/2024 14:25,Lol. I know right? Part of my issue with what they did to vaping and what’s “popular” with pouches. It always starts with good intentions with adults looking for less harmful ways to consume nicotine and ends up with a bunch of “new” people looking to “catch a buzz” it ruined the vaping community/industry and will probably eventually kill this here in the US at least. I try to stay off of soap boxes because nobody cares but the over simplification of the evils of nicotine &amp; how the powers that be lean into it for prohibition purposes when nic had nothing to do with what made smoking so harmful to begin with. It should be respected and consumed responsibly however. But when I saw the “kids” start vaping without having been smokers looking for 50-60mg liquids just ‘cuz. Now it’s transitioning over here for people that never smoked OR vaped it just drives me absolutely mad.,3,Sesh doesn’t get much mention around here.
02/11/2024 14:52,"You’re pretty much took all of the words right out of my mouth lol. I started vaping senior year of high school (after first smoking cigs at 14) with cig a like vapes and moved up from there all the way to cloud blowing mods then eventually I hopped on the juul train and that sent my nicotine tolerance way up. Moved down to Florida in 2019 and started having throat problems from all of the vaping high nic juul and vuse pods. Then at some point I found out about nicotine pouches and snus and nic pouches and started using zyn wintergreen and general mint. I eventually stopped nicotine pouches altogether, and switched over to regular Swedish snus which still is doing me well. I tried to go back to vaping for a little while but it didn’t stick and I don’t see myself ever going back again, plus as you said one of the biggest problems with vaping now is that it’s geared towards high nicotine, fruity, disgusting, flavored disposables and nic salt. I hope nicotine pouches don’t follow the high nicotine disposables but that seems to be where some brands are heading. I have no idea how people use some of these pouches that are 20 30 or 50 mg of nicotine.🤢",3,Sesh doesn’t get much mention around here.
02/11/2024 15:24,"Thank you!! Finally someone I can exchange these stories with. I’m estimating I’m older than you but similar experiences. I smoked 2.5 packs a day from 18 to about 36. Found vaping in 2013 with an old school cigalike, transitioned to super over priced OG Blu kits. Found the OG vape reviewers on YouTube and dove all the way in. Suffered through all the earlier crap technology and was a halfway decent reviewer myself. We actually learned a lot about nic titration, safe voltage and battery limits etc. Got too far in to the “cloud chasing” fad and dropped my nicotine too low too fast and actually fell off the wagon &amp; went back to cigs for about a year stupidly. JUUL actually did reel me back home but 65mg was too much on a long term and unlike most people high nic gives me serious fatigue and makes me really tired. JUUL served a good temporary purpose because damn their mint was 🔥 and it was a similar enough experience to make me put cigs down for good. Finally I settled into decent pod systems and sensible 10-20 mg mint flavored salt. After so many years of that I realized I wasn’t enjoying it anymore. I tried Swedish snus for a while, then some pouches and was duel using. Finally a couple of months ago vaping just became a thing I did…and the sensible thing is why inhale something extra into your lungs if you don’t even enjoy it. Unlike most people giving up nic isn’t a reason I decided not to vape. So I’m very pleased to have found some decent strength &amp; subdued flavors that I enjoy during the day and evening. The difference between our approach &amp; theirs is having a habit &amp; looking for ways to sensibly &amp; safely enjoy…compared to purposely trying to pick up a habit at an insane level that simply isn’t necessary. Nobody started smoking to start a dependency. It’s all so backwards. The over the top fruity flavors are further proof one would be looking to jump into it as a “fun” thing to do. And sadly, gives credence to the prohibitionists that want to kill everything designed for responsible adult consumption because of “the kids”. This ain’t the place to look for a “buzz” so damn ridiculous.",2,Sesh doesn’t get much mention around here.

02/22/2024 19:26,"Agreed. It’s never the same. One of your competitors switched to China manufacturing and it’s not as good.

Zyn for the US market is horrible in my opinion and was blown away when I had the genuine article for the first time. I had tried snus initially in an effort to quit vaping which I did to quit smoking but the overseas shipping and wait time just didn’t make it stick. This time I was able to completely switch and so happy I found Sesh. I think you’ll find there a lot of people that will find your product that understand the quality that Sweden produces although they may be in smaller pockets scattered around the forums. But they’re out there. Sorry for the wall of words, but thanks for all you’re doing in this space. Oh…one more thing.

Thomas is the original inventor of Zyn, Dryft, Nordic Spirit pouches along with assisting on many other formulas you see in Europe and the US today.

02/10/2024 22:35,Thanks for the thorough reply. I’m gonna get a can of each flavor to try next time I order. I love Lucy but I’m not ready to step down to 4mg yet. Hopefully nicokick has the 3 for $10 pack back in stock by then,2,Sesh doesn’t get much mention around here.

07/05/2024 18:35,"It’s just an alternative nicotine device. First was cigarettes and chewing tobacco. Bad for you but feels good. Then came vaping or “electronic cigarettes” - not as bad health-wise, so a better way to still get your nicotine fix.Now you have Zyn (and many others such as On!, Rogue, Velo, Zone, FRĒ, Sesh, etc.) I think the first real ones were Snus but they really didn’t catch on, until now. Zyn is the big name brand kingpin that’s basically like the Coca-Cola or Marlboro of the pouch world. Basically just nicotine salt in a pouch you put in your lip similar to chewing tobacco, without all the bad byproducts of the tobacco - just pure nicotine getting dissolved into your bloodstream, which gives you a buzz. Much safer and healthier than any of the alternatives.(Hell - they even make *coffee pouches* under the brand “GRINDS” which are basically ground coffee in a little pouch you put in your lip?

03/17/2024 22:53,"8mg is just kind of viewed as a higher end of the unofficial ""standard"" strength, and anything 1mg-8mg is just an accepted framework in the US. I can only think of Fré and Juicehead being the only two widespread quasi locally available pouches that exceed 8mg (granted Lucy, NIC-S, Sesh, and others are available online.) Vape liquids were commonly in the same ball park (3-12mg being fairly standard) yet many, MANY companies would offer up to 24mg, and once refillable pod systems became available, the same 50mg that was once relegated to disposable/prefilled vapes became fairly common. I used to think it was odd that pouches relegated themselves to the low end versus vaping that grew exponentially to fill any and all offerings. Then again, vaping was attacked and is now a shell of what it once was, so maybe they are iffy about drawing even more attention then they already are. Then again, vape products weren't subject to the 2009 ""Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act"" until 2016, and still further time until they were informed that they were subject to the PMTA requirements of tobacco products. Currently synthetic nicotine products are exempt from the act, but that could easily change at anytime as it did with vape products. TL:DR; The US market has had a ""standardized"" mg range for products for a long time. If Swedish Match/Zyn didn't try to bring higher mg products to market previously, they almost certainly won't do it now as Senator Schumer is beating the war drums against Zyn with their current 3mg/6mg offerings.",9,Why don't we get these strengths in the US?

06/08/2024 05:47,I haven’t tried zyn winterdgreen but XQS wintergreen is my go to,3,Zyn Wintergreen alternative
06/07/2024 23:19,Zone Wintergreen. I prefer them over Zyns,4,Zyn Wintergreen alternative
06/09/2024 08:01,Sucks though I don't think Zones sell a 3mg pouch.,2,Zyn Wintergreen alternative

06/07/2024 22:26,"Told myself I’d never buy rogue again due to how harsh they are on the gums, but since the zyn shortage I’ve bought a few cans already. I just alternate where I put them in my lip to avoid irritation. Super high quality pouches, nice and soft, but the flavor is so intense",4,Zyn Wintergreen alternative
06/07/2024 22:31,I think they changed their formula cause the gum issues aren’t happening any more. To be honest I haven’t had this issue.Zone has a pretty good wintergreen.I’m also curious about grizzly nicotine pouches but haven’t been able to find some near me. I’m on the hunt.,3,Zyn Wintergreen alternative
06/07/2024 22:37,Good to know. I just can’t stand the On! Wintergreens so don’t wanna make that mistake again. The zyn ones just have that perfect taste/little burn. I’ll try the rogues out.,2,Zyn Wintergreen alternative
06/10/2024 19:07,They haven’t changed the formula from what I’ve heard. I think your gums just get used to it after a while.  Not sure if that’s good or bad tho.,1,Zyn Wintergreen alternative
06/13/2024 23:06,I got them. Not a fan. They smell like tobacco and taste like chemicals. Very disappointed in grizzly pouches.,1,Zyn Wintergreen alternative
06/08/2024 01:31,You get to a point where you enjoy the burn. At least I do.,1,Zyn Wintergreen alternative
06/08/2024 03:52,I enjoy the burn too. It’s just if I’ve been placing the rogue pouch in the same spot over and over again my gums will start to peel and then it stings,1,Zyn Wintergreen alternative
06/08/2024 03:18,zone wintegreen for sure and they have 9mg which are nice if ur used to 6s,2,Zyn Wintergreen alternative
06/09/2024 08:06,I can't believe they don't do 3mg though. Kind of limited their market. Like they designed a product to quit nicotine that doesn't even go below 6mg? That's kinda ridiculous.,2,Zyn Wintergreen alternative
06/09/2024 09:37,"yeahhh i get u man, but for a fellow 6mg user who sometimes needs a little kick, the 9mg is perfect for me ngl",1,Zyn Wintergreen alternative
06/10/2024 19:09,Heard the Grizzlys pouches are only in 9mg. Annoying.,1,Zyn Wintergreen alternative
06/12/2024 00:00,"I’m in the same boat, Velo Wintergreen is the best alternative I’ve found. Taste seems more natural than zyn but a little bit harsher on the gums. Tried Rogue, I have almost the full tin still left, not a fan.",1,Zyn Wintergreen alternative
06/08/2024 00:11,Rogues are the best,1,Zyn Wintergreen alternative
06/08/2024 00:28,Velo wintergreen,1,Zyn Wintergreen alternative
06/08/2024 00:52,Copenhagen wintergreen: long cut. You can thank me later,1,Zyn Wintergreen alternative
06/07/2024 22:52,Rogue Wintergreen is good &amp; is more moist. I’d definitely recommend Copenhagen Longcut Wintergreen though.,1,Zyn Wintergreen alternative
06/07/2024 23:07,Sesh wintergreen isn’t terrible. Wet pouch and the flavor lasts a while,0,Zyn Wintergreen alternative
