(altria), rogue, juice head, fre, lucy, and sesh, among various others.**what is haypp?***brief history*haypp is an online retailer and distributor of nicotine pouches and snus. the company was started by a couple of swedish teenagers in 2009 and through mergers and acquisitions they no longer are in charge of the company as the current ceo joined in 2017/2018. the company bought nicokick.com and northerner.com (northerner owns 9% of stock) which are now both of their main american brands. they switched from snus to nicotine pouches 6 years ago and haven’t looked back.[domains owned by haypp group](https://preview.redd.it/gr3kxwm5anzc1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=383bb5d7ac692fe7323192c608ae812b46f4e7c1)haypp currently owns a roughly 85% online market share for their nordic part of the business, which they refer to as their “core” business as well as a \~55% market share of the oral nicotine market (85% market share of the nicotine pouch e-commerce market) for their growth market which is considered the us, uk, germany, and swiss countries.[market share of haypp](https://preview.redd.it/r9y53fg7anzc1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b11912ca8e532bc15d9b2d918bc4fa2673c3a917)[haypp vs closest competitor in each

obviously be a hyper competitive online industry? the main reason for their hyper success in the online market is that they have a death grip on the seo landscape. their mastery of seo allows them to spend almost nothing on marketing and to keep pushing out their distribution system (which continues to drive costs down for them and consumers). this creates a positive feedback loop as they become even cheaper than their competitors, allowing them to lock in customers (over 90% of the customers becoming recurring customers).[how consumers find haypp](https://preview.redd.it/qevmp0qaanzc1.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad031f2035197c31f321a03926d954b33f2357b4)[haypp marketing expenses as a &amp;#37; of

there is probably a 95%+ chance that the top unpaid search result will be a haypp group domain. even niche searches such as “what is an upper decky” (gen. z slang for nicotine pouches) or basic searches such as “what are the top nicotine pouches” you will see that haypp group owns the top of the search.https://preview.redd.it/e7ocu0jdanzc1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8e80b8d743de3dc9133504bd6ff85dbbaee48bb[google searches highlighting the seo power of

advertising that addictive products can utilize on their search engine. haypp ends up barely spending anything on marketing due to 40% of new customers coming through word of mouth and the rest from seo.*data*their other field of expertise is data collection and selling. due to the large variety of pouches and being the number one online seller of nicotine pouches, they have created a major database which they sell to various nicotine pouch producers such as philip morris and altria. producers buy these on an annualized basis, and you can see the usage of their data among the investor relation reports/presentations/websites of various producers. as you can see from my beautiful pictures on this post, they compile plenty of data to help me understand the business better. *lowest cost seller and best e-commerce distribution*due to their distribution network, haypp has become one of the cheapest (if not the cheapest) sellers of nicotine pouches in the world. you can buy zyn’s cheaper from haypp websites than you can from the zyn website. haypp’s prices are 20-40% cheaper than grocery stores and 30-50% cheaper than convenience stores.they have been integrating their distribution network so that most variable costs are being converted to vertical fixed costs creating operating leverage for them as they rapidly scale their revenue and are able to increase margins. they have implemented 2-day delivery across the us and close to implementing across europe markets as well.https://preview.redd.it/0sajvfgkanzc1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3aad16b9df1be7bf6bbcc8f16ebf8c469c15b3a0[haypp

last part of their business model is their ability to leverage their large consumer base to help new products capture market share, which allows them to capture higher margins on their products and it increases the variety of products which consumers would like to buy. in nordic countries the variety of products is a benefit to them as consumers want to try various brands and flavors. when this competition trend hits the us it will only benefit them even more. **why haypp vs pouch companies**currently in the us there are only a couple main brands with zyn owning a huge chunk of the market. in europe, velo is the most popular brand but there are many nordic brands that consistently attack margins and currently there is little competition in the us market which most likely won’t last much longer. as consumers search out the cheapest product and try to hunt for variety, haypp will be that future as convenience stores lag in variety and cost.products such as zyn will definitely continue to grow (currently zyn is growing at 70% y/y) but we could see margins shrink as competition becomes fiercer and consumers branch out away from the first movers, although zyn continues to take up 70% of the us market. this only further benefits haypp as they are the go-to spot for a large amount of variety. although they don’t benefit as much from less competition, they are still beneficiaries of an oligopoly esque market due to their cost and distribution networks.most large publicly traded pouch companies are also cigarette and chewing tobacco sellers who are rapidly seeing those segments get cannibalized by vaping and nicotine pouches combined with regulatory crackdown risk. since haypp has no exposure to either one, you will not experience any cannibalization outside of snus cannibalization in the nordics. this is the best pure play bet on nicotine pouch consumption.certain countries have limited the ability for consumers to have access to nicotine via retail stores which will allow them to take huge shares of the overall market in places like germany or in california where they have banned flavored nicotine products in retail stores has led to windfall of customers to haypp’s e-commerce model. **management**the current ceo of haypp group, gavin o’dowd, used to work for british american tobacco (bat) and was the driving force for the velo acquisition. he currently owns 3.6% of the stock and various other pe firms and family offices own large chunks of haypp. most executives have warrants that could give them the right to 200k-400k shares each (29m shares outstanding with no serious history of dilution). **regulations**as many of you are aware, regulations are a huge part of the nicotine industry. taxes are going to be huge risks, which are then combined with flavor bans. i think nicotine pouches are one of the products that are least likely to get hit with serious bans since their health risk is much lower than almost any other nicotine product.the nicotine pouch industry as a whole has been behaving spectacularly well when it comes to ensuring they are not purposefully marketing to young people. they are trying to avoid having a juul 2.0 fiasco which basically murdered that business and completely fragmented the vaping industry which is on the brink of regulatory crack down.haypp does their part by ensuring age regulation across their whole site. they have age verification to order and deliver. they have a huge emphasis on ensuring that they abide by the law. **financials***core segment (nordic countries)*the company is growing heavily in every segment that it operates in. its core segment seems to be slowing down in growth due to heavy cannibalization from snus sales. this should only be temporary as nicotine pouch volume grows at 30%+ y/y. once snus nears its cannibalization endpoint, i would expect revenue to begin growing again in its core market (although not at 30%). current revenue is $250m usd and ebitda is about $18m usd for just the core segment for the last twelve months. management expects high single digit ebitda margins for 2025.[core segment sales and ebitda margin](https://preview.redd.it/yzcdzgtoanzc1.png?width=526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b25fafa6bcdf821a4a36de2cafa09aaa625b67bf)*growth segment (us, uk, germany, switzerland)*the growth segment is skyrocketing. growth is over 46% y/y and this growth has been consistent and should continue to be consistent. ebitda margin for the growth markets has begun to inflect positively which will cause a massive amount of leverage in their ebitda to occur as their fixed cost model begins to do its job. as economies of scale drive forward, we should see this margin increase substantially over the coming years. currently revenue is at $77m usd for growth markets and ebitda is at -$3.5m usd.[growth segment sales and ebitda margin](https://preview.redd.it/5dwt225qanzc1.png?width=515&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09f25d4e92c17667ae4129e1d28e0b3a0be59a9b)*let’s talk about the growth segment a bit more.*this is where the real value from haypp will come into play. while it currently begins to inflect positive in terms of profitability, it should be noted that the growth markets have a massive tam compared to their core market and could cause the company to 5x in the next few years if they maintain or gain market share and continue to grow in these massive tams.*total tam growth*as they grow, their competitive advantage deepens due to sticky customers and cheaper products from economies of scale. the us has an even faster scale of 49%+ growth y/y and haypp is outpacing the us nicotine pouch growth at 57% y/y. as the us begins to approve various products and variety begins to flood the us market, a ton of us users want to try various nordic brands that don’t have access which lends a very strong lean towards an online website such as haypp. the us is a very ripe environment along with the uk and germany (where nicotine can only be sold online) for haypp to continue to outperform massively.*emerging segment*their “emerging” segment is where they have begun to introduce vapes into their value chain. haypp is beginning to sell vapes to uk and germany, but it is at the very beginning stages and has no current significant impact on their bottom or top line. the company says the growth they are experiencing in this segment has been very similar to the growth that they experienced when they introduced nicotine pouches in growth markets. this is the most likely segment to get hit with regulatory concerns, so for now i won’t even consider this in a to be a profitable unit and will just assume it will be a small drain on ebitda for the foreseeable future.*balance sheet*the balance sheet is great with no large debt burden and good working capital management. as they hit profitability this year/early next year i would expect a cash build up until the company decides if they will be returning cash to shareholders or reinvesting in the business. **valuation**haypp is extremely undervalued based on where they are from a profitability standpoint and their current inflection point. due to their high growth, it will be hard to pinpoint an exact value on them so this will merely be an exercise in estimating their value among a range more than usual (anyone who claims they can perfectly value a high growth company is probably overvaluing due to unsound conviction). first let’s look at how they are currently valued, which is roughly 14x their **core** ebitda. now let’s take a second and think about how insane that statement was. their core market is the nordic countries which will be hitting growth again as their snus cannibalization slows, the nordic countries basically have no further regulation risk for nicotine pouches, and it is a noncyclical industry. i would argue that 14x their core ebitda is probably an appropriate valuation based on **only** their core segment.what this means is (if you haven’t noticed already) that you are getting their “growth” segment for **free** based on the valuation of the stock. the growth segment alone is probably worth multiples of the current stock price due to the massive tam and extreme growth prospects. if we assume the emerging segment is worthless (which it isn’t and it will be profitable at some point) then that means all of the upside in the stock can be based on what the value of the growth segment. based on tam, growth, and lack of cyclicality then this leaves the only risk as regulation.there will most likely be some sort of regulation, but we are very far from that as the tobacco industry has been very careful in how they implement their new nicotine pouch momentum in a more appropriate way compared to vapes. the most likely regulations will probably be flavor bans of some sort or retail bans (which further benefits haypp). regulations will most likely be limited in scope due to just the sheer lack of mortality risk associated with pouches vs any other form of common nicotine intake.based on their probable conservative revenue growth (40% average for the next 3 years, and 15% after that), ebitda growth, the fact that they will have both core and growth markets at high single digit ebitda margins in 2025, and their lack of cyclicality, then i would estimate that their growth markets are worth a very conservative $400m-$500m usd. i am likely undershooting the valuation because they are driving profitability very fast and their revenue is growing closer to 40%-60% in growth markets right now. if they are able to keep up current growth figures and expand to double digit margins before the end of the decade then they could be worth 2x-3x this value (which is why valuing growth companies are so hard, because i can’t foresee the future). again, i valued the emerging segment as worthless which is unlikely as well.so, based on the value of $450m usd for the growth markets and the current value of $240 usd for the nordic markets, that would create a sum of the parts equal to roughly $700m or nearly triple the current share price. this valuation leaves a ton of room for margin expansion and higher growth prospects because let’s face it, the us alone is probably worth at least 3x-5x more than the nordic countries not including the uk, germany, or swiss. this is a very conservative valuation for the company, but it shows how great the risk/reward is based on the current price. using a conservative valuation here also helps accommodate for regulation risk.in sek terms this would be 250 sek/share or 7.35b sek.**conclusion**even accommodating for regulation risk, a valuation of $700m seems appropriate as a starting point for the valuation for haypp group. i think there is a very high likelihood that i could be off on this by a large margin, but i feel like the downside is very protected with this valuation. management has been great in execution and i expect that to continue. in a more bullish case where every segment of the company fires on all cylinders we could see a valuation of $1.5b+, but that is not a scenario that i would like to bet my investors’ money on. for now, i will stay invested and keep watching them execute and adjust my valuation accordingly.*disclaimer: the author of this idea and his fund have a position in securities discussed at the time of posting and may trade in and

02/11/2024 15:24,"thank you!! finally someone i can exchange these stories with. i’m estimating i’m older than you but similar experiences. i smoked 2.5 packs a day from 18 to about 36. found vaping in 2013 with an old school cigalike, transitioned to super over priced og blu kits. found the og vape reviewers on youtube and dove all the way in. suffered through all the earlier crap technology and was a halfway decent reviewer myself. we actually learned a lot about nic titration, safe voltage and battery limits etc. got too far in to the “cloud chasing” fad and dropped my nicotine too low too fast and actually fell off the wagon &amp; went back to cigs for about a year stupidly. juul actually did reel me back home but 65mg was too much on a long term and unlike most people high nic gives me serious fatigue and makes me really tired. juul served a good temporary purpose because damn their mint was 🔥 and it was a similar enough experience to make me put cigs down for good. finally i settled into decent pod systems and sensible 10-20 mg mint flavored salt. after so many years of that i realized i wasn’t enjoying it anymore. i tried swedish snus for a while, then some pouches and was duel using. finally a couple of months ago vaping just became a thing i did…and the sensible thing is why inhale something extra into your lungs if you don’t even enjoy it. unlike most people giving up nic isn’t a reason i decided not to vape. so i’m very pleased to have found some decent strength &amp; subdued flavors that i enjoy during the day and evening. the difference between our approach &amp; theirs is having a habit &amp; looking for ways to sensibly &amp; safely enjoy…compared to purposely trying to pick up a habit at an insane level that simply isn’t necessary. nobody started smoking to start a dependency. it’s all so backwards. the over the top fruity flavors are further proof one would be looking to jump into it as a “fun” thing to do. and sadly, gives credence to the prohibitionists that want to kill everything designed for responsible adult consumption because of “the kids”. this ain’t the place to look for a “buzz” so damn ridiculous.",2,sesh doesn’t get much mention around here.

02/22/2024 17:20,you’re doing a great job. the fact they’re manufactured in sweden makes a world of difference imo. much closer to the brands i’ve imported over the years but ended up being cost and time prohibitive. much continued success.,1,sesh doesn’t get much mention around here.
02/22/2024 17:28,"thanks, great to know that people care about the fact it's made in sweden. it matters to me, but we've had so many offers to move to facilities in china or india but anytime i've tried samples the quality diff. is so noticeable to me. obviously, shipping is more expensive, and we're looking at either us/cdn facilities as we grow but for now we're sticking with sweden.",3,sesh doesn’t get much mention around here.
02/22/2024 19:26,"agreed. it’s never the same. one of your competitors switched to china manufacturing and it’s not as good. i can’t speak for this whole sub but i know offline a lot of people only want swedish made products. bottom line is they know it better than anyone. zyn for the us market is horrible in my opinion and was blown away when i had the genuine article for the first time. i had tried snus initially in an effort to quit vaping which i did to quit smoking but the overseas shipping and wait time just didn’t make it stick. this time i was able to completely switch and so happy i found sesh. i think you’ll find there a lot of people that will find your product that understand the quality that sweden produces although they may be in smaller pockets scattered around the forums. but they’re out there. sorry for the wall of words, but thanks for all you’re doing in this space. oh…one more thing. your flavorings don’t taste like pure sucralose and don’t leave a weird aftertaste either. that’s damn near worth the price of admission in and of itself.*edited to say - i don’t mind paying a bit more to absorb higher shipping costs.",2,sesh doesn’t get much mention around here.

07/05/2024 18:35,"it’s just an alternative nicotine device. first was cigarettes and chewing tobacco. bad for you but feels good. then came vaping or “electronic cigarettes” - not as bad health-wise, so a better way to still get your nicotine fix.now you have zyn (and many others such as on!, rogue, velo, zone, frē, sesh, etc.) i think the first real ones were snus but they really didn’t catch on, until now. zyn is the big name brand kingpin that’s basically like the coca-cola or marlboro of the pouch world. basically just nicotine salt in a pouch you put in your lip similar to chewing tobacco, without all the bad byproducts of the tobacco - just pure nicotine getting dissolved into your bloodstream, which gives you a buzz. much safer and healthier than any of the alternatives.(hell - they even make *coffee pouches* under the brand “grinds” which are basically ground coffee in a little pouch you put in your lip? i guess you can suck on them to get that caffeine into your system without all the having to drink liquid? idk)",5,there is no better start to the day
06/30/2024 23:14,"imo, zone, fre, rogue (if your gums can handle it) are all better. us velo is trash, juice head is trash. i still wanna try sesh, lucy, lucy breakers.",1,the zyn shortage is effecting me :(
07/01/2024 00:24,"the mint fre are my least favorite. the wintergreen is really good, i like the sweets whenever i was something without flavor and the lush is alright i guess. i've seen sesh on nicokick too, they look good and i think they are on sale right now so i'm gonna test them",1,the zyn shortage is effecting me :(
04/30/2024 15:50,in my opinion the best nicotine pouches sold in the u.s. are rouges and sesh.,-2,trash.

05/20/2023 07:26,rogue tore the shit out of my gums after one day. switched to sesh.,1,trying to quit vaping by using pouches but my gums are killing me
07/07/2024 12:00,fre is a good one too! similar to swedish pouches...sesh is superior imo,2,"us velos are cheeks, how much better are the swedish ones? "
07/07/2024 12:09,i’ve been needing to try sesh mango for a while now. but ya know.. it’s hard to not order the norm lol,1,"us velos are cheeks, how much better are the swedish ones? "
07/07/2024 12:32,i heard that! mango sesh are so good! i have a can that i've been picking at here n there lol living in cali have too order it. good thing a few stores near me sell flavored pouches,1,"us velos are cheeks, how much better are the swedish ones? "
07/06/2024 23:47,"swedish brands like xqs, nic-s, and sesh aren’t too bad. found some in my city. xqs and sesh pouches feel pretty comfortable.",2,"us velos are cheeks, how much better are the swedish ones? "

03/17/2024 06:50,sesh is very close i don’t know why no one talks about them but i’ve stopped ordering from overseas once i found them. limited on flavor options but the ones they have are great,1,what's an american pouch similar to european velo?

08/24/2024 01:24,"true but it's annoying as hell they're taking away 2 flavours,meanwhile i bought cinnamon flavoured sesh gum which are displayed right up at the checkout counters. makes no sense. i'll gladly let the gov restrict nic gums in exchange for zonnic to be let out of the cage,lol.",3,what are we doing now that zonnic is effectively banned?

08/02/2024 17:32,fre or sesh are good choices!,2,what brands of moist pouches are available in american stores?
11/29/2023 02:27,im in manitoba and there’s an insane amount of demand with no supply. all stores sell out within half an hour of delivery if they even get the delivery.. 711 has sesh gum as an alternative option but it does not sell at all. debating switching to it just to have something to curb the nic cravings from quitting vaping,2,what happened to zonnic in canada?
12/11/2023 19:06,"i’ve been using sesh since i posted my original comment and it does help quite a bit, but zonnic actually takes the vape craving away where i’m finding sesh is only making me crave vaping more 🫠",2,what happened to zonnic in canada?
05/19/2024 23:39,bought a sesh mango when picking up zyns. not terrible. i want to try the mint ones next to compare.,1,what product is closest to zyn? 
07/03/2024 01:27,"that's a really interesting idea as somebody who also hates dry pouches. i was also surprised by fre, i've only tried lush but it's probably the third best brand i've tried after lucy and sesh. only tried the sesh mango as well, looking to try some of their minty flavors.",1,what went wrong 
12/19/2023 17:29,i’ve been looking everywhere as well and i think there’s a shortage. it’s really helped me with quitting smoking and now they’re out everywhere.. now i’m using a nicotine gum called “sesh” and it’s helping but i’m not a fan of gum in general.,5,where are all the zonnics?!?

04/07/2024 23:29,try sesh. they sell them in on northerner and nicokick as well as the sesh website. they have been my daily for about 2 months since i quit vaping,1,where to find moist pouches in usa?
04/08/2024 12:46,sesh mint jor frē sweet pouches are my go-to,2,where to find moist pouches in usa?
08/13/2024 03:21,sesh is my favorite. i get them online but they’re so easy on my gums that i’ll throw in a zone with them just to spice things up. sesh is my unwind type of pouch.,1,which pouch is easiest on the gums?
06/10/2024 13:00,"fré, zone, sesh, lucy breakers, nic-s are all moist american brands. i get all mine online, but i've seen people on here find some of these brands in stores",7,why does the us only get dry portions? 
06/10/2024 17:05,"lucy and frē are considered moist pouches. i haven't tried any of the newer brands like sesh, ubbs or zimo. when i came back to np's i went straight to eu pouches",1,why does the us only get dry portions? 
08/22/2024 16:35,"they're not bad, and they last a while too.  it was a one and done for me because of the size.  the rogue is twice as big as a xyn.  i've read about messing up your gums, or receding gums, something like that, so i've stuck with the xyn chill 3 mg (my favorite).  if on budge, the on! brand isn't bad at all.  i still haven't tried velo, sesh or zone.  does anyone know if those ones are worth trying?",1,why do i hear so much bad about rogue pouches?
03/17/2024 22:53,"8mg is just kind of viewed as a higher end of the unofficial ""standard"" strength, and anything 1mg-8mg is just an accepted framework in the us. i can only think of fré and juicehead being the only two widespread quasi locally available pouches that exceed 8mg (granted lucy, nic-s, sesh, and others are available online.) vape liquids were commonly in the same ball park (3-12mg being fairly standard) yet many, many companies would offer up to 24mg, and once refillable pod systems became available, the same 50mg that was once relegated to disposable/prefilled vapes became fairly common. i used to think it was odd that pouches relegated themselves to the low end versus vaping that grew exponentially to fill any and all offerings. then again, vaping was attacked and is now a shell of what it once was, so maybe they are iffy about drawing even more attention then they already are. then again, vape products weren't subject to the 2009 ""family smoking prevention and tobacco control act"" until 2016, and still further time until they were informed that they were subject to the pmta requirements of tobacco products. currently synthetic nicotine products are exempt from the act, but that could easily change at anytime as it did with vape products. tl:dr; the us market has had a ""standardized"" mg range for products for a long time. if swedish match/zyn didn't try to bring higher mg products to market previously, they almost certainly won't do it now as senator schumer is beating the war drums against zyn with their current 3mg/6mg offerings.",9,why don't we get these strengths in the us?
06/26/2024 15:44,"lucy is the best pouch i've tried in the u.s. mango and mint are my favorites, don't care for the other flavors. sesh mango is pretty good too, though i've only seen them at buc-ee's, not sure if you have them over there.both of these are *leagues* better than zyn imo",2,zyn shortage 
06/26/2024 23:07,"lately ive  been on the hunt for sweden pouches. they are the softest and doesnt seem to mess with my gums. i was lucky to find some called sesh, xqs, and lucysesh and xqs were nice and comfortable. not extremely sweet.there will be spots out there that have em still at a premium. im in ca",2,zyn shortage
