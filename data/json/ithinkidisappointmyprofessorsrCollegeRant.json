I'm very smart, but school just wasn't what I wanted. So I took a break.\n\nLast fall, I finished the last semester of my associates degree after having an over 7 year break (I did a full contract in the Army Infantry, then went to automotive technical school and worked in that field for 2.5 years). I made Dean's List that semester with over 95% in all of my 4 classes.\n\nAt the time, I was undiagnosed and unmedicated for ADHD. I was diagnosed about 2 months after I graduated with my associates. Now, I'm getting my bachelor's in engineering.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you have to *want* to do it. REALLY want to do it. If you're struggling in school right now, ask yourself if college is really what you want. There is absolutely no shame in taking a step back to reevaluate your choices and find a different path. If you're set on finishing your degree, which I encourage, you need to completely go against your ADHD urges. It starts with showing up to class every single day without fail (early!) and doing your homework until all of it is done. If you do just those 2 things, I promise you, your grades will handle themselves and you won't have half as much stress. Again, I also have ADHD. I 1000% relate to you on this.",

                        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 10 years ago, I went to college and couldn&amp;#39;t handle school. I just couldn&amp;#39;t show up to class, keep track of assignments, etc... I was miserable. I hated it. I&amp;#39;m very smart, but school just wasn&amp;#39;t what I wanted. So I took a break.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last fall, I finished the last semester of my associates degree after having an over 7 year break (I did a full contract in the Army Infantry, then went to automotive technical school and worked in that field for 2.5 years). I made Dean&amp;#39;s List that semester with over 95% in all of my 4 classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was undiagnosed and unmedicated for ADHD. I was diagnosed about 2 months after I graduated with my associates. Now, I&amp;#39;m getting my bachelor&amp;#39;s in engineering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have ADHD, you have to &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do it. REALLY want to do it. If you&amp;#39;re struggling in school right now, ask yourself if college is really what you want. There is absolutely no shame in taking a step back to reevaluate your choices and find a different path. If you&amp;#39;re set on finishing your degree, which I encourage, you need to completely go against your ADHD urges. It starts with showing up to class every single day without fail (early!) and doing your homework until all of it is done. If you do just those 2 things, I promise you, your grades will handle themselves and you won&amp;#39;t have half as much stress. Again, I also have ADHD. I 1000% relate to you on this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
