Now they are RED where i put them .\n\nBut now, my teeths are a little bit sensitive, not really irritating but i noticed it, my gums are a little bit sore, i always rotate my pouches but still.\n\nAnd probably the worst is my stomach, i have stomach cramps because of nic pouches. Im gonna start using them but i will never swallow them.\n\nIm really debating if this is normal, and this constant irritation wont cause problems like cancers and such.\n\nI KNOW that nicotine doesnt cause cancer, but its not that, its the constant irritation where you put your pouches, THAT can cause cancer.\n\nMy dentist said, when you put these pouches into your gum over and over again and you are irritating them, they will go under mutation, and that may predispose or directly cause an oral cancer, from that repititve damage, and nic salts are very irritating to the gums. And he said its called, squamous cell carcinoma related cancers. Its not the nicotine, that causes cancer,  its the POUCH and the nicotine combined  that irritates your gum tissue. There's a foreign body in your gum line every single day.  He said 90% of gum cancers starts liket that. Irritation. Take this as you will, almost everyone on this sub is nicotine pouch fanatic, i truly do understand that, it looks like this is the most safest way to consume nicotine, sadly i use them daily too,  but theres a risk still to cancer as i stated above. And im not a beginner, in terms of using nicotine, smoked and vaped a lot sadly before this. it was like this Smoking then IQOS then VAPING and now, Nicotine Pouches.
