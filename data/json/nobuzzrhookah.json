Someone can tolerate more, someone less, everyone smokes the way they want. Etiquette for hookahs also exists (find it on Youtube). For example, the hookah hose should always be placed freely on the table. Whoever wants to smoke from the hose, takes the hose himself and smokes 1x-2x and then puts it back on the table. The hookah hose must not be given - there is a risk of gouging the eyes or other situations. There is more and it is simply the etiquette of serving hookahs, which few people know :-D. But enough about the conservative lifestyle.\n\nTry with your friends to find a common solution. For example, a hookah can be filled in such a way that if you draw smoke deep into your lungs with a large volume, you will feel dizzy. However, if you smoke less or only once and then rest for 2 minutes, your head should not spin. Well... and a smoker who needs more nicotine takes up to 3 puffs in a row from the hose.\n\nI recently started combining herbal + classic hookah tobacco together. That's because the nicotine-free herbal one has mint in it, and I don't have anything else with mint. So the combination of 30% mint (herbal manufacturer Tanya) + 70% cherry (Al Fakher standard hookah tobacco) means that if I smoke from the hose, I have to take 5-6 puffs to finally feel the nicotine in my body (and in my head) . However, a friend who can't even take 1/2 puff of smoke from the hose during normal hookah smoking, because he has a different nicotine tolerance, praises this. With new fillings of tobacco, my friend can take even 1 strong puff of smoke - into full lungs (once and then pause for 1-2 minutes).\n\nIn the same way, the Al Fakher tobacco I mentioned, which belongs to the slightly drier types of hookah tobacco (there is not much glycerin), can be prepared as a strong, but also as a weak tobacco. If I use a traditional type of bowl, I fill 25g of tobacco using the fluffy method in this traditional bowl, I set a higher power of the heat source, so you can feel a really strong \"buzz effect\". However, if I fill Al Fakher as fluffy, in a bowl phunnel type, and when I use a HMD with a thick bottom plate, then the nicotine is barely perceptible. This is because the HMD in conjunction with the phunnel bowl works on the principle of evaporation of water vapor (glycerin - white dense clouds) and aroma (infused in glycerin), but the hot air only minimally gets through the tobacco layer (than in the case of the traditional type bowl).",
