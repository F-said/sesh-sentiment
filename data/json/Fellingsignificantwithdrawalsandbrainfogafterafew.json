I ended up having two more the next two nights before finally being like \"ok this is stupid\" and stopped a few days ago.\n\nOver the last few days I have had really significant brain fog and fatigue. I later realized that these fucking baby cigars have 100-200mg of nicotine in each of them. I used to use nicotine pouches (quit like a month ago) and thats like 5x the amount of nicotine I used to get over the course of a day using the fucking pouches, all in the span of like one 10 minute walk sesh. Also I inhaled most of the cigars, stupid I know but I wanted the buzz I guess. I had no idea these were so nicotine PACKED.\n\nI'm assuming this is contributing to a way more intense withdrawl yeah?\n\nHow long will this shitty feeling last? Obviously thats a shit ton of nicotine compared to my prior habit, and obviously inhaling cigar smoke is BAD BAD, but still Im shocked my brain is this foggy after 3 uses. And it doesnt even feel like cravings which is the weirdest part. Theres no part of me that feels tempted to go back to smoking cigars, but my brain is just like SOMETHING IS MISSING.\n\nIve also been dealing with some possible dust allergies, so it COULD be that as well, but my dust allergies have never been this bad ever. Maybe it's both too! Ahhhhgh",
